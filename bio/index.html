    <p class="main">Hi, I'm just some dumb fuck called wiglett/wiglett_/wigl3tt. I've been actively playing Geometry Dash for only about two years now, and I'm proud to say that I'm currently the top player in New Brunswick, as ranked by Pointercrate.

        <br><br>My journey in Geometry Dash has been filled with exciting challenges and accomplishments. If you were to ask me what my hardest completed level is, I'd tell you it's Deflective by mojitoz. However, according to the unrated demonlist, Phonk Town stands out as my toughest challenge by far, although I find it nowhere near as hard and have even beaten it twice.
        
        <br><br>At the moment, I'm working on Cognition and have reached 64%. While it's been a tough grind, I'm considering whether to continue pushing forward or to shift my focus to new challenges. Macabre has been quite fun, so I might put down Cognition for just a bit, I'm not too sure though.
        
        <br><br>Outside of Geometry Dash, I enjoy things like mathematics and physics, I'll be entering my first year of university in a few months to study them. I also absolutely adore trivia, and was the team captain for my high school when we made it to a national finals tournament
        
        <br><br>Thank you for visiting my site, and feel free to reach out if you want to connect or discuss anything about the game or just to chat!</p>
